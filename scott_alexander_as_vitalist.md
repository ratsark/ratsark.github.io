# Scott Alexander As Vitalist

Scott Alexander recently put together a couple of posts on Nietzscheanism, one covering [the synthesis of master and slave morality](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/matt-yglesias-considered-as-the-nietzschean) and another comparing [vitalism and altruism](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/altruism-and-vitalism-as-fellow-travelers).

Here I'll make the case that:
1. Vitalism is a personal philosophy, not a political one.
2. Vitalism is not in conflict with altruism, and certainly not with effective altruism.
3. Scott Alexander is a vitalist.

## Caveats - why you should and shouldn't listen to me

Please take me as one voice among many, worthy of consideration but in no way an authority. I'm no expert; I'm just a philosophy major who has been deeply influenced by Nietzschean philosophy and ethics.

I'm using "vitalism" here to refer to Nietzschean ethics, not specifically to the construct of the will to power and its correlates.

I also know very little about modern Nietzscheanism; I have a direct relationship to Nietzsche that may be totally different. So please forgive me if I miss the point -- I may be like a mystic defending Christianity when what is really being criticized is the Catholic church. But if that's the case I can at least help turn Nietzsche against modern Nietzscheans.
