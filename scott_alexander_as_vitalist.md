# Scott Alexander As Vitalist

Scott Alexander recently put together a couple of posts on Nietzscheanism, one covering [the synthesis of master and slave morality](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/matt-yglesias-considered-as-the-nietzschean) and another comparing [vitalism and altruism](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/altruism-and-vitalism-as-fellow-travelers).

Here I'll make the case that:
1. Vitalism is a personal philosophy, not a political one.
2. Vitalism is not in conflict with altruism, and certainly not with effective altruism.
3. Scott Alexander is a vitalist.

## Caveats - why you should and shouldn't listen to me

Please take me as one voice among many, worthy of consideration but in no way an authority. I'm no expert; I'm just a philosophy major who has been deeply influenced by Nietzschean philosophy and ethics.

I'm using "vitalism" here to refer to Nietzschean ethics, not specifically to the construct of the will to power and its correlates.

I also know very little about modern Nietzscheanism; I have a direct relationship to Nietzsche that may be totally different. So please forgive me if I miss the point -- I may be like a mystic defending Christianity when what is really being criticized is the Catholic church. But if that's the case I can at least help turn Nietzsche against modern Nietzscheans.

## Vitalism as a personal philsophy

The latter piece mentioned above -- "Altruism And Vitalism As Fellow Travellers" -- helpfully summarizes itself:

> My response: in most normal cases, altruism and vitalism suggest the same solutions. The two diverge from each other in Extremistan, but in Extremistan each one also diverges from itself, shattering into innumerable incoherent and horrible outcomes. So we should mostly concentrate on the normal cases where they converge. Iâ€™m suspicious of anyone who gets too interested in the extreme divergent cases, because I think many of these people are actively looking for trouble (eg excuses for cruelty) and should stop.

To construe vitalism as a coherent political philosophy and judge it on the society it would build is to miss the point entirely: vitalism is a base philosophy about values. It attempts to address the most fundamental question, "how should I live?"

One possible answer is "I should imagine the society in which I want to live, and structure my life to bring about that society." One can then move on to asking "what society would I like to live in?" -- which is the level at which Scott compares vitalism and altruism.

But vitalism does not support this move. To reduce vitalism to social maxims like "make society strong" or "empower the talented" would be like reducing Buddhism to "people should live in monasteries". To some extent this may be accurate, but (1) these are contingent recommendations, not fundamental, and (2) analysis at this level obscures understanding rather than facilitating it.

Why are these contingent? Because they're not ends in themselves; these are merely conditions that might help the intrinsically valuable things grow. Or they might not; as Scott accurately points out in the piece, maximizing conflict does not maximize self-actualization:

> I think both altruists and vitalists have a shared interest in figuring out the structures (capitalism? monopoly? friendly rivalry?) that maximize progress without devolving into anyone actually getting nuked.

Why does this analysis obscure understanding of vitalism? Because this emphasizes a second-order understanding of vitalism, and in an area where Nietzsche himself was famously inconsistent. If you try to understand Buddhism by looking at [what it recommends to laypeople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Householder_(Buddhism)), this is a reasonable-enough shadow of the core Buddhist beliefs that you may be able to work back to an understanding. But vitalism's shadow on "how we should order our society" is like a shadow cast on a cloudy day. Something something strength, something something talent, something something philosopher kings, something something iconoclasm.

### Understanding Vitalism

As I said above, vitalism is about fundamental values; about answering the question "how should I live?" This is difficult terrain for a rationalist, as there's nothing compelling for rationalism to grab onto. Once we agree on values we can go out into the world and figure out how to maximize those values, but in setting those values initially one must look inward and see what one finds compelling.

So the question of "how should I live?" quickly becomes one of "what do I value?" Note the move from _should_ to _do_ -- the question is not "what should I value?", for we are operating at a level so low that we can only observe what we do and don't care about. Of course this is influenced by others and by ourselves, but our base inclinations are not _decided_ in the same way that we can construct our beliefs. I don't choose to find old concrete walls beautiful any more than I choose to find tomatoes disgusting.

If one cannot reason about these deep and fundamental judgments, then is one doomed only to describe them? No: one can make perspectival arguments that help others see things in the same light that you do. This was an important Nietzschean insight, and is key to understanding his style. His flowery language is not merely an affectation; it's an attempt to help his readers see the same fundamental beauty that he does. This what Nietzsche means when Zarathustra says "They do not understand me, I am not the mouth for these ears" -- not everyone will find the same things compelling that he does.

And indeed, Nietzsche goes a step further -- he very explicitly wants fellow travellers, not followers or disciples. He wants to inspire people to look deep within themselves, past the internalized shoulds and should nots ("beyond good and evil"), and find what motivates them, personally.

He outlines this in the first speech by Zarathustra, On The Three Metamorphoses, which talks about how one's spirit becomes a camel, then a lion, then a baby. In short, the camel upholds all the wisdom that came before, the lion questions and destroys it, and the baby creates anew.

And while any answer choice of raison d'etre is fine, he also puts his thumb on the scale. At this deep level, Nietzsche tries to evoke a lust for life, a "yes-saying", a spirit of joy and levity directly in opposition to gravity. This is summed up at the end of "On The Spirit Of Gravity" in Zarathustra book 3:

> A trying and questioning was my every move; and verily one must also learn to answer such questioning. That, however, is my taste -- not good, not bad, but _my_ taste of which I am no longer ashamed and which I have no wish to hide.
>
> "This is _my_ way, where is yours?" -- thus I answered those who asked me "the way." For _the_ way -- that does not exist.

## Vitalism and Altruism

Given the description above, it should be obvious that there is no basic incompatibility between Nietzschean ethics and altruism. Anyone who takes an honest account of themselves will discover deeply prosocial tendencies (with the possible exception of psychopaths). And in building from the base level of values to politics we bring in all of the familiar arguments for altruism.

But that's not to say there are no conflicts:

1. A person who is deeply motivated by their own values may choose not to be involved in altruism or building a better world in the abstract. They may be motivated by a desire to make great art, collect Pokemon, find love, or become rich. We might wish these people would become active participants in these endeavors, but generally I see no great conflict here - these people just go on living their lives and neither help nor hamper those trying to improve the world.

2. A vitalist could become an activist, and fight for what they believe is important. E.g. they might be motivated by compassion for animals and fight against factory farming. (Let's not forget that when Nietzsche had his psychotic break he rushed to the assistance of a horse that was being beaten in the street!) There may or may not be a conflict with altruism, depending what value motivates the vitalist.

3. A vitalist *could* become a vitalism activist, i.e. someone who tries to promote vitalism and bring the world into alignment with some vitalist vision of how the world should be. This is a reasonable thing to do, but I want to point out that being a vitalism activist is a very different thing from being a vitalist -- in much the same way that being a gamer is different from being a gaming activist. These seem to be the people that Scott is in conversation with in his blog posts.

Let's take a minute and inhabit the third point of view, that of a vitalism activist. I think Scott's posts in some ways make a compelling appeal:

* People are more likely to align with their deepest values if they have their basic needs met, but we should also incentivize greatness (with money, power, etc.). Our society is a reasonable mix of capitalism and socialism that accomplishes these goals.

* Effective altruism is proximately aligned with the goal of improving the soil from which vitalism can grow in the world.

I think these make a strong case for an alliance between these two groups. But in such an alliance I would expect the vitalist activist to push certain points of disagreement like these:

1. Happiness or minimizing suffering is not the goal; the goal is something closer to self-actualization. In cases like preventing malaria these two moral systems are aligned, but they may diverge in other places (e.g. animal welfare, which individual vitalists may care about but which do not advance the vitalist cause).

2. While there may be value in doing good for others, one should be careful not to forget about other values. An altruism-focused movement may reward extreme devotion to altruism, but for a vitalist movement it is equally critical to celebrate one's own flourishing. (And extreme devotion to altruism can even be one form of flourishing! It cannot be the only one, however.)

These are in no way dealbreakers; honestly I think the alliance would do both sides some good.

To those who would say Nietzsche was all about strength and didn't care about altruism at all, I give you Nietzsche:

P137 On the three metamorphoses
P156 On the preachers of death
P172 On love of the neighbor
P303 On the spirit of gravity
